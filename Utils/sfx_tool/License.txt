SFX Tool is based on Nullsoft Install System. For that reason SFX Tool contains MakeNSIS v2.0, NSIS Modern UI v1.70, various official NSIS plugins (BGImage, InstallOptions, LangDLL, StartMenu, UserInfo) and lots of resources (graphics, language files, etc.) that ship with the official release of NSIS v2.0. Some of that resources have been modified or renamed. 

The zlib/libpng license applies to NSIS.
