      SFX Tool provides an easy way to create your own SFX installers. Such SFX installers - as the name implies - consist of only one single executable file, that can be run stand-alone. This is very usefull for releasing your software through the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      One key feature of SFX Tool is the ability to set up all installer options through a simple graphical user interface. This means there is no need to learn any nasty scripting language.
    </p>
    <p>
      The installers created with SFX Tool provide all key features well-known from professional install systems:
      <li>a modern, WinXP conform graphical user interface
      <li>multi-language support
      <li>a built-in uninstall system
      <li>the ability to create startmenu/desktop shortcuts
      <li>lots of options to adjsut the installer's appearance
      <li>various high efficient compression methods
      <li>a self-test (CRC check) to avoid broken installers
      <li>and much more...

      SFX Tool is based on <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Nullsoft Install System</a>. For that reason SFX Tool contains MakeNSIS v2.11, NSIS Modern UI v1.70, various official NSIS plugins (BGImage, InstallOptions, LangDLL, StartMenu, UserInfo) and lots of resources (graphics, language files, etc.) that ship with the official release of NSIS v2.0/v2.11. Some of that resources have been altered.
