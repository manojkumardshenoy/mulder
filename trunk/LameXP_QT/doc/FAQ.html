<a name="6a0b023d"><b>What is LameXP ???</b></a><br>
<br>
LameXP is a graphical user-interface for a number of audio encoders. It was developed to support a huge<br>
number of input formats. File formats are detected reliably using MediaInfo. Compressed audio formats are<br>
decoded to uncompressed Wave files using suitable CLI audio decoders. Furthermore LameXP allows batch<br>
processing of multiple audio files. Multi-threading is implemented by processing several audio files<br>
concurrently. All the third-party tools incorporated in LameXP are listed in the "About" dialog. The Nero AAC<br>
encoder cannot be redistributed due to licensing issues; it is available as a free download from the public<br>
Nero web-site. Note: LameXP does NOT use/need any "external" audio decoders. It neither requires nor supports<br>
any ACM Codecs or DirectShow/DMO filters! And it will NOT install anything of that kind on your system.<br><br>

<a name="96205e91"><b>My anti-virus program raises an alarm when I try to download/install/launch LameXP. Why is that?</b></a><br>
<br>
Occasionally your anti-virus program may mistakenly(!) detect "malware" (e.g. virus, trojan horse or worm) in<br>
LameXP. This is called a "false positive" and the file is actually innocent/clean. It's an error in your<br>
specific anti-virus software. So in case you encounter such problems, please use <a href="http://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank">http://www.virustotal.com/</a>,<br>
<a href="http://www.virscan.org/" target="_blank">http://www.virscan.org/</a> or a similar online-service to check the file in question with multiple(!) anti-virus<br>
engines. Especially take care with scan results like "suspicious", "generic" or "packed", as such results are<br>
NOT confirmed malware detections and in almost any case they can be ignored/discarded safely!<br>
<br>
Apparently anti-virus programs tend to suspect installers or uninstallers created with <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">NSIS</a>. Furthermore some<br>
anti-virus programs blindly suspect all "packed" executables of being malware. Obviously that is a stupid<br>
generalization, so please ignore these nasty warnings! Last but not least: Always keep in mind that LameXP is<br>
OpenSource software. If you don't trust the provided pre-compiled binaries, simply download the <a href="#982cf1c0">source codes</a>,<br>
search the code for "malicious" functions (you won't find any!) and then <a href="#a0c1e92b">compile</a> your own binary.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<ul>
<li>IN CASE YOU HAVE A CONFIRMED INFECTION, RE-DOWNLOAD THE FILE FROM ONE OF THE *OFFICIAL* MIRRORS!
<li>DO NOT SEND US VIRUS REPORTS, UNLESS YOU HAVE VERIFIED THE INFECTION WITH MULTIPLE ANTI-VIRUS ENGINES!
<li>PLEASE REPORT "FALSE POSITIVES" TO THE DEVELOPER OF YOUR ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE. WE CANNOT FIX THEM!</ul>

<a name="fd53d98a"><b>Who created LameXP?</b></a><br>
<br>
LameXP was written from the scratch by LoRd_MuldeR &lt;MuldeR2@GMX.de&gt;. However it has to be noted that LameXP<br>
uses a number of third-party tools, which have been created by the individual authors. Moreover various<br>
people have contributed LameXP translations. Please see the "About" dialog for details!<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="de1c5e44"><b>What license is LameXP released under?</b></a><br>
<br>

<br><br>

<a name="303e5fa7"><b>Do I have to pay for LameXP? / How can I donate to the authors of LameXP?</b></a><br>
<br>
LameXP is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software" target="_blank">free software</a>, so you may use it for free and for any purpose. Moreover the authors of LameXP<br>
currently do NOT accept any donations. Therefore you should NOT pay or donate any money in order to obtain<br>
LameXP! However it was brought to our attention that some dubious third-party web-sites offer "payed"<br>
downloads of LameXP and/or include Adware into the LameXP download. We do NOT cooperate with any of these<br>
sites. So if you pay for the LameXP download, the authors of LameXP will not get a single cent! Instead you<br>
should save your money and download LameXP from one of the official mirrors (see below), which is 100% free.<br>
<br>
If you want to support the development of LameXP, you can do so by contributing translations and/or code :-)<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="71a113b0"><b>How do I enable AAC/MP4/M4A output (encoding) in LameXP?</b></a><br>
<br>
LameXP uses the Nero AAC Encoder for creating AAC/MP4/M4A files. The Nero AAC Encoder is available as a free<br>
download. However the license doesn't allow redistribution! Therefore we can NOT ship the Nero encoder along<br>
with LameXP. Instead you will have to obtain the Nero encoder as a separate download from the official "Nero<br>
Digital" web-site. Currently you'll find the latest Nero AAC Encoder version at this location:<br><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nero.com/deu/downloads-nerodigital-nero-aac-codec.php" target="_blank">http://www.nero.com/deu/downloads-nerodigital-nero-aac-codec.php</a></ul>
<br>
After you have downloaded the Nero AAC Encoder as a ZIP file, you must "install" the encoder binaries, so<br>
LameXP can use them. Simply unzip the files 'neroAacEnc.exe', 'neroAacDec.exe' as well as 'neroAacTag.exe' to<br>
the same directory where your LameXP executable ('LameXP.exe') is located. For unzipping the ZIP file you can<br>
use any suitable archiver, such as <a href="http://rarlabs.com/download.htm" target="_blank">WinRAR</a> or <a href="http://sevenzip.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a>. Once the required Nero encoder binaries are located in<br>
the LameXP directory, the AAC encoding option should be "enabled" on the next startup of LameXP.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="126abc5a"><b>Is there a way to output ".m4a" or ".aac" files with LameXP?</b></a><br>
<br>
LameXP uses the Nero AAC Encoder for AAC encoding. And the Nero encoder always puts the AAC streams into an<br>
MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14) container - in almost any case that is exactly what you want/need! The one and only<br>
"correct" file extension for MP4 files is '.mp4'. However sometimes the "incorrect" file extension '.m4a' is<br>
used to indicate "audio-only" MP4 files. Even worse: There are some buggy (hardware) players that will<br>
recognize MP4 audio file only with the "incorrect" .m4a extension, but NOT with the "correct" .mp4 extension.<br>
Of course LameXP will save your MP4 files with the "correct" .mp4 extension. But if you need your MP4 files<br>
with an .m4a extension for some reason, you can simply rename(!) these files. This isn't more or less<br>
"incorrect" than saving the files as .m4a directly. After all, an MP4 file remains an MP4 file.<br>
<br>
Having said that, you should NOT rename any .mp4 or .m4a files to .aac, because these are MP4 files and NOT<br>
"raw" AAC streams. The Nero AAC encoder has NO option to output "raw" AAC streams and usually you don't need<br>
such streams. Still, if you want to extract the "raw" AAC stream from an MP4 file, you can use <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/mp4box" target="_blank">MP4Box</a>.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="ebf016ab"><b>How do I enable WMA input (decoding) in LameXP?</b></a><br>
<br>
WMA input requires the WMA decoder component to be installed on your local computer. Usually LameXP will show<br>
a warning on startup, if the WMA decoder component could not be found. In that case you can simply choose<br>
"Download &amp; Install" in order to install the WMA decoder component on your system. Alternatively you can<br>
also install the WMA decoder component manually by choosing "Install WMA Decoder" from the "Tools" menu. In<br>
any case you must restart LameXP after the WMA decoder component has been installed.<br>
<br>
It has to be noted that the WMA decoder component relies on the Windows Media Format Runtime. All supported<br>
versions of Microsoft Windows should have the Windows Media Format Runtime installed out of the box. However<br>
Wine does not! In case you encounter problems with the WMA decoder component, try downloading and installing<br>
the <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Windows_Media_Format_11.htm" target="_blank">Windows Media Format 11 Runtime</a> manually. This should also work under Linux/Wine.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="9fd53558"><b>How can I use LameXP as a "portable" application?</b></a><br>
<br>
LameXP always is "portable", in the sense that the application works out of the box: LameXP does NOT require<br>
any additional software, such as codecs, encoders, decoders or runtime libraries, and it will NOT install<br>
anything of that kind on your local computer! All the third-party tools used by LameXP are already built-in.<br>
There currently are two notable exceptions: The Nero AAC encoder and the WMA decoder cannot be redistributed<br>
along with LameXP for legal reasons. Therefore these tools have to be obtained as separate downloads.<br>
<br>
Having said that, LameXP stores its configuration file in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378457(v=vs.85).aspx#FOLDERID_LocalAppData" target="_blank">%LOCALAPPDATA%</a> folder on the local computer.<br>
That's because on a modern multi-user operating this is the only "correct" folder to store user-specific<br>
configuration files. Also it's one of the few folders where an application is guaranteed to get write-access,<br>
even when the application was launched by a "normal" (non-admin) user and did not request elevated rights.<br>
Storing the configuration file in the "install" folder is antiquated and highly error-prone.<br>
<br>
Still some users may want to store the configuration file in the same folder as the LameXP executable file,<br>
e.g. when launching LameXP directly from their USB stick on different computers. For this purpose LameXP now<br>
offers a "true" portable mode. You can enable that mode simply by renaming the LameXP executable file to<br>
"LameXP-Portable.exe". But be aware: When running LameXP in the "portable" mode, the user(!) must ensure that<br>
write-access is granted to the directory where the LameXP executable is located.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="df406578"><b>The LameXP startup (splash screen) takes very long on my system. What can I do?</b></a><br>
<br>
Starting up LameXP shouldn't take longer than approximately 10 seconds. However it was brought to our<br>
attention that badly optimized anti-virus software can slow down the startup procedure a lot! On our test<br>
system (Windows 7 running on an Intel Core2 Q6600 with 4 GB of RAM) starting up LameXP takes about 3 seconds<br>
without an anti-virus software and about 6 seconds with the "real-time protection" of Microsoft Security<br>
Essentials enabled. With other anti-virus software the startup was delayed up to 20 seconds and more!<br>
<br>
So if you think that LameXP is starting up too slow on your system, you should temporarily(!) disable or<br>
uninstall your current anti-virus program and try again. Usually it should be sufficient to disable only the<br>
"real-time protection", "file system protection" or "guard" feature of your anti-virus software. If it turns<br>
out that the startup is significantly(!) faster WITHOUT the anti-virus software, please report the problem to<br>
the developer of the anti-virus software. And, if they don't fix the problem, switch to a better product!<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="9b0a5c32"><b>Why does application 'xyz' not open the Wave files created by LameXP?</b></a><br>
<br>
Some of the decoders used in LameXP will insert an additional 'JUNK' chunk into the Wave/RIFF file, right<br>
before the 'fmt' chunk ("Wave header"). There are technical reasons why this 'JUNK' chunk (placeholder) might<br>
be needed at the beginning of the file. The 'JUNK' type is a standard RIFF type and, by definition of the<br>
RIFF file format specification, any reading application must ignore/skip all 'JUNK' chunks it may encounter!<br>
Evidently most reading applications do so and thus will correctly open the Wave file. Unfortunately it was<br>
brought to our attention that there are a few broken(!) applications, which reject Wave/RIFF files with an<br>
additional 'JUNK' chunk in front of the 'fmt' chunk. It seems that these applications make false assumptions<br>
and expect the 'fmt' chunk to be located at a fixed position, rather than parsing the RIFF structure.<br>
<br>
While it is evident that applications, which reject the Wave/RIFF file because of the extra 'JUNK' chunk, are<br>
broken with respect to the RIFF specification and should be fixed by the respective author, there is an easy<br>
workaround: Re-saving the Wave/RIFF file with <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">SoX</a> creates a file that even the broken applications seem to<br>
accept, as SoX apparently doesn't insert any 'JUNK' chunks (although it would be free to do so!) Re-saving<br>
your Wave file with SoX does NOT change the actual content at all, as long as no additional filters are used.<br>
<br>
You can use a command-line like this:<br>
<blockquote>sox.exe "c:\some path\input.wav" "c:\some path\output.wav"</blockquote>

<br><br>

<a name="89cbd3d0"><b>Why does LameXP run only 'n' parallel instances/threads on my computer?</b></a><br>
<br>
By default LameXP will detect the number of CPU cores that are available on your system and run as many<br>
encoder/decoder instances in parallel as CPU cores are available. This is done in order to maximize the CPU<br>
usage on modern multi-core processors and thus speed up the overall encoding process. However be aware that<br>
the number of instances that can run in parallel is also limited by the number of files you are converting.<br>
Consequently the number of instances that will run in parallel is the minimum(!) of the number of CPU cores<br>
and the number of files to convert. Moreover the number of parallel instances is currently bounded at four!<br>
<br>
Limiting the maximum number of parallel instances to exactly four might seem somewhat arbitrary. But the more<br>
instances are running in parallel, the more instances will be competing for the hard disk. At some point this<br>
will result in "HDD trashing" and actually slow down the encoding process! The limit will prevent this<br>
situation on computers with a lot of CPU cores. If, however, you want to use even more (or fewer) instances,<br>
then you can use LameXP's option to manually overwrite the maximum number of parallel instances/threads.<br>
<br>
Also be aware that LameXP only controls the number of instances that will run in parallel, but it does NOT<br>
control how many threads an individual instance will create! Some encoders use "built-in" multi-threading and<br>
thus a single encoder instance may create several threads - LameXP has no control over that.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="12d077d5"><b>How can I force LameXP to create ID3 version 2 (ID3v2) tags?</b></a><br>
<br>
The LAME encoder automatically chooses the proper ID3 tag version. By default it will create a version 1 tag,<br>
if possible. Only if the information cannot be embedded into a version 1 tag (ID3v1), e.g. because the string<br>
is too long or the string contains Unicode characters, a version 2 tag (ID3v2) will be added. This behavior<br>
is advisable, because devices that support ID3v2 tags should also be able to read ID3v1 tags - but this<br>
doesn't apply the other way around! Moreover embedding an ID3v1 and an ID3v2 tag at the same time, although<br>
the information would have fit into a single ID3v1 tag, means an unnecessary redundancy!<br>
<br>
If, however, you need to enforce the creation of an ID3v2 tag for some reason, you can use the "--add-id3v2"<br>
parameter for that purpose. Simply add the parameter to the "Custom Encoder Parameters" for LAME.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="4213adbc"><b>Can LameXP be used to convert/extract tracks from an Audio CD?</b></a><br>
<br>
LameXP can be used to convert audio files that have been extracted from an Audio CD, but it can NOT extract<br>
or read the audio tracks from the Audio CD directly (yet). Consequently you will have to extract ("rip") the<br>
audio tracks first, before you can convert them with LameXP. We recommend using the <a href="http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/" target="_blank">Exact Audio Copy</a> software<br>
for that purpose. When ripping tracks from an Audio CD you should always save the tracks as uncompressed Wave<br>
files or as lossless FLAC files! This will avoid a quality loss during the extraction/ripping process.<br>
<br>
Warning: The Windows operating system will show CDA files (such as "Track01.cda") on an Audio CD. These are<br>
dummy/fake files! Actually an Audio CD does NOT contain a file system and thus there are NO files. There only<br>
are audio tracks on an Audio CD. These audio tracks can be extracted as files (e.g. Wave Audio files) using a<br>
ripping software and then the extracted files can be converted. At the same time any attempt to copy/convert<br>
the '.cda' files directly is destined to fail (as the '.cda' files do NOT actually contain any audio data).<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="e7c9ae2b"><b>Why do I get the error 'Executable doesn't support Windows compatibility mode' on startup?</b></a><br>
<br>
LameXP was designed to run on all supported platforms natively (except for Linux/Wine). If you see this error<br>
message, that's probably because your system is configured to run LameXP in 'compatibility mode', i.e. your<br>
system will pretend an older OS version than is actually running. In Windows Explorer you can disable(!) the<br>
compatibility mode by right-clicking on the 'LameXP.exe' file, choosing 'Properties' from the context menu,<br>
switching to the 'Compatibility' tab and un-checking the 'Run this program in compatibility mode' option.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="328b0a18"><b>Why do I get the error 'Executable requires Windows 2000 or later' on startup?</b></a><br>
<br>
You are trying to run LameXP on a platform that is NOT supported, such as Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows<br>
Millennium Edition or Windows NT 4.0. There is nothing you can do about that, except for updating to a less<br>
antiquated OS. Running an outdated/unsupported OS is a severe security risk anyway!<br>
<br>
Note: This error can also occur, if your system has been configured to run LameXP in <a href="#e7c9ae2b">compatibility mode</a>.<br><br>

<br><br>

<a name="491aaad9"><b>Why do I get the error 'A device attached to the system is not functioning' on startup?</b></a><br>
<br>
This error message from the Windows operating system is somewhat misleading. It often appears together with<br>
a second error message and it means that Windows was unable to load/execute the program file. There are<br>
various reasons why this error might occur, but usually it indicates that you are trying to run LameXP or the<br>
LameXP setup/update program on a platform that is NOT supported, such as Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows<br>
Millennium Edition or Windows NT 4.0. There is nothing you can do about that, except for updating to a less<br>
antiquated OS. Running an outdated/unsupported OS is a severe security risk anyway!<br>
<br>
Remark: Executable files compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (or later) won't load on Windows 9x.<br><br>

<a name="a0c1e92b"><b>What are the prerequisites to build LameXP from the sources?</b></a><br>
<br>
LameXP is currently being developed using the following build environment:<br><ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2008, Service Pack 1
<li>Qt libraries v4.7.2 for Windows (VS 2008)
<li>Microsoft Windows SDK v7.1</ul>
<br>
Also note the following hints:<br><ul>
<li>You must launch Visual Studio using "qtvars.bat vsstart" in order to enable the Qt tools
<li>The Microsoft Windows SDK v6.0A should work as well, with a few limitations
<li>In order to make a fully "static" build of LameXP, you need to compile Qt as static libraries
<li>Support for the GNU Toolchain (GCC/MinGW + Make) is planned for a future version</ul>
